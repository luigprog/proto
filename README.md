PROTO
====================
It is a programming game, where the user give artificial inteligence to a robot by code, so it can move avoiding obstacles and reach the target.
The robot can move, jump and climb stairs. The user must use these robot's abilities correctly. 
A little example of the robot's A.I.: if there is a hole at the front, jump, else, walk.
My motivation to do this project was my admiration for games and robotics. Also, I did not found many similar things on the internet.
The game is developed in Java, with Slick2D.

Do you wanna play it?
